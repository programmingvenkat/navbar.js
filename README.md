# Navbar.js a tool for making easy dynamic navbars
If you have ever tried to add a navbar to a static site, you'll know the pain of adding a 
new link in _every_ single page which has the navbar. But with a dynmic navbar, all you'll 
have to do when making a new page is simply `{link : 'mypage.html', name : 'Mypage'}`. And 
also easy add the `active` class automatically.
